# book-search-engine

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to utilize Google Books API to create an application for a user to find and save a book list. This type of functionality is used across many entertainment and management applications.

The user is able to search for books, save books, and remove books. This is all based on whether the user is logged in. When they are not logged in, many of the functionality is locked behind authorization locks.
